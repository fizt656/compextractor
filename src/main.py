        Analyze the following transcript and extract insights about student competency development based on the provided competency definitions. Generate an HTML report that includes an analysis for EACH of the competencies in the competency definitions text. Focus on identifying evidence of competency development, areas for improvement, and specific examples from the transcript that demonstrate competency-related behaviors or knowledge.

        Competency Definitions:
        {competency_definitions}

        Transcript:
        {transcript}

        Please provide a structured HTML report of competency development, including:
        1. A section for the transcript
        2. A section for competency insights, with subsections for each competency
        3. Evidence of competency development for each defined competency
        4. Areas for improvement or further development
        5. Specific examples from the transcript that demonstrate competency-related behaviors or knowledge
        6. Overall assessment of the student's competency development

        Use appropriate HTML tags to structure your report. Include inline CSS for basic styling. Ensure the HTML is well-formatted and easy to read. The HTML structure should be as follows:
